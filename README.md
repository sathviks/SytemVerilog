# SytemVerilogFundamentals
SytemVerilogFundamentals 100 code challenge Starting from May - 2023


WELCOME TO MY 100DAYSOFRTL  My Name is Sathvik S, I mostly use Xilinx Vivado Design Suite and sometimes Modelsim  and Eda playground software for the simulation of RTL Codes. And The Synthesis is performed by using Intel Quartus Prime Software.


Passionate about VLSI design with practical expertise using Xilinx Vivado and other EDA tools. Looking
for an opportunity in the semiconductor industry to work on innovative projects and collaborate with
experts and continune learning.


This repository contains sample snippets of code that illustrates SystemVerilog concepts

The examples/svbasics directory has several examples that can be run to understand following concepts
 1) data types - logic vs bit - operators
 2) Arrays, Queues
 3) Class definition, objects, inheritance, virtual methods
